# NESremu
**Author :** RÃ©mi Pelletier  
**Description :** NESremu is a simple NES emulator written in C++ (Work in progress).   

## Goal  
Produce a decently efficient and mostly accurate NES emulator capable of running most popular titles.  

## Motivations  
- Acquiring a better understanding of computer architecture.  
- Learning more about the NES hardware.  
- Overcoming the challenge of producing an emulator of a console which I am fond of.
